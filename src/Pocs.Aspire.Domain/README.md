# Pocs.Aspire.Domain

## Overview

The Domain project is the core of the Pocs.Aspire application, containing all business entities, value objects, and repository interfaces. This project follows Domain-Driven Design principles and encapsulates the essential business rules and concepts.

## Architectural Responsibility

This project is responsible for:

- Defining the core domain models and entities
- Establishing value objects for immutable domain concepts
- Defining repository interfaces for data access
- Maintaining domain integrity through business rules
- Remaining persistence-ignorant (no dependencies on infrastructure)

## Technical Approach

The Domain layer uses:

- **Rich Domain Models**: Entities with behavior rather than anemic data models
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing concepts without identity
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstractions for data access without implementation details
- **Pure C# Classes**: No framework dependencies to maintain separation of concerns

## Key Features

1. **Business Entities**:
   - Core domain models representing business concepts
   - Clean separation from infrastructure concerns
   - Rich domain behavior where appropriate

2. **Clean Interfaces**: Clearly defined contracts between domain and infrastructure

3. **Domain Primitives**: Value objects that encapsulate validation and business rules

## Design Considerations

- Domain entities use the C# record type for immutability where appropriate
- Interfaces define clear contracts for the infrastructure layer
- No external dependencies to maintain a clean domain model
