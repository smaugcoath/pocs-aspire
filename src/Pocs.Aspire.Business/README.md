# Pocs.Aspire.Business

## Overview

The Business project contains the application services and business logic for the Pocs.Aspire solution. It sits between the Domain and API layers, orchestrating use cases and enforcing business rules.

## Architectural Responsibility

This project is responsible for:

- Implementing application services that coordinate domain operations
- Enforcing business rules through validation
- Orchestrating workflow across multiple domain entities
- Implementing transactional boundaries
- Providing a clean application API for the presentation layer

## Technical Approach

The Business layer uses:

- **Service Pattern**: Focused business operations with clear responsibilities
- **Functional Result Pattern**: Better error handling with LanguageExt
- **Validation**: Business rule enforcement with FluentValidation
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean interfaces for testing and flexibility

## Key Features

1. **Application Services**:
   - Coordination of domain operations
   - Business logic orchestration
   - Use case implementation

2. **Validation**:
   - Input validation for business operations
   - Business rule enforcement
   - Consistent validation approach

3. **Result Pattern**:
   - Functional approach to success/failure handling
   - Clear error context without exceptions
   - Consistent result handling

## Design Considerations

- Services represent distinct business capabilities
- Validation occurs before domain operations
- Results provide clear success/failure states
- Dependencies are clearly defined and injected
